1.  A header file, in this case stdint, is included. This
specific header file is used to increase the portability
of code. stdint specifically provides typedefs and macros
for fixed width integral types in accordance with the
C99 standard.
2. Using those particular types makes it so that everyone
who uses them can expect them to be of the exact
same fixed width. This creates portability if everyone
agrees to use them.
3.  BYTE: 8 bits, DWORD: 32 bits, LONG: 32 bits, WORD: 16 bits
4.  0x42 0x4D in hexadecimal, same as BM in ASCII
5.  bfSize is the bitmap file size in bytes. biSize is
the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER header file. The latter
is a constant of 40 bytes.
6.  It indicates a top-down device independent bitmap. These
can't be compressed.
7.  It's the biBitCount field.
8.  In case the files specified do not exist or the
user opening them does not have sufficient permissions.
9.  Because only 1 element is read at a time, in this case
an element like BITMAPFILEHEADER and BITMAPINFOHEADER
10. 3 * 24 = 72. 72 % 4 = 0. 4-0 = 0. 4 % 4 = 0. The answer
is 0.
11. It's sets the position of a stream at a particular
offset. This allows to skip over bytes.
12. It's the current position of the file pointer
